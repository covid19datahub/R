\arguments{
\item{country}{vector of country names or \href{https://github.com/covid19datahub/COVID19/blob/master/inst/extdata/db/ISO.csv}{ISO codes} (alpha-2, alpha-3 or numeric).}

\item{level}{integer. Granularity level. 1: country-level data. 2: state-level data. 3: lower-level data.}

\item{start}{the start date of the period of interest.}

\item{end}{the end date of the period of interest.}

\item{raw}{logical. Skip data cleaning? Default \code{TRUE}. See details.}

\item{vintage}{logical. Retrieve the snapshot of the dataset that was generated at the \code{end} date instead of using the latest version. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{logical. Print data sources? Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cache}{logical. Memory caching? Significantly improves performance on successive calls. Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{wb}{character vector of \href{https://data.worldbank.org}{World Bank} indicator codes. See details.}

\item{gmr}{url to the \href{https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/}{Google Mobility Report} dataset. See details.}

\description{
Download COVID-19 data across governmental sources at national, regional, and city level.
Includes the time series of vaccines, tests, cases, deaths, recovered, hospitalizations, intensive therapy, 
and policy measures by \href{https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker}{Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker}.
Provides a seamless integration with 
\href{https://data.worldbank.org/}{World Bank Open Data}, 
\href{https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/}{Google Mobility Reports}, 
\href{https://covid19.apple.com/mobility}{Apple Mobility Reports}.
}
\details{
If \code{raw=FALSE}, the raw data are cleaned by filling missing dates with \code{NA} values. 
This ensures that all locations share the same grid of dates and no single day is skipped. 
Then, \code{NA} values are replaced with the previous non-\code{NA} value or \code{0}.

The dataset can be extended with \href{https://data.worldbank.org}{World Bank Open Data} via the argument \code{wb}, a character vector of indicator codes.
The codes can be found by inspecting the corresponding URL. For example, the code of the GDP indicator available at \url{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD} is \code{NY.GDP.MKTP.CD}.
The latest data available between the \code{start} and \code{end} date are downloaded.

The dataset can be extended with \href{https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/}{Google Mobility Reports} via the argument \code{gmr}, the url to the Google CSV file.
At the time of writing, the CSV is available \href{https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/Global_Mobility_Report.csv}{here}. 

The dataset can be extended with \href{https://covid19.apple.com/mobility}{Apple Mobility Reports} via the argument \code{amr}, the url to the Apple CSV file.
At the time of writing, the CSV is available \href{https://covid19-static.cdn-apple.com/covid19-mobility-data/2023HotfixDev26/v3/en-us/applemobilitytrends-2021-01-01.csv}{here}.
